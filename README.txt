My objectives for the Telco Project are:

1. Find the drivers for customer churn at Darden Telco.

2. Construct a model to predict customer churn using classification techniques.

3. Document code, process (data acquistion, preparation, exploration and testing, modeling, and evaluating, and findings and key takeaways in a Jupyter Notebook report.

4. Present a high-level notebook walkthrough targeted to an audience of my data science peers.


My goals when working through the Telco Project:
1.Find drivers for customer churn with Darden Telco.

2. Construct a machine learning classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.

3. Create modules that make my process  easily repeateable.

4. Maintain a well documented process that is easy to understand.
